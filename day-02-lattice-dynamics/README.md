# Density functional perturbation theory: Hands-on session

**Tutors**: Alberto Carta, Alfredo Fiorentino, Libor Vojacek

## Environment setup

Activate the working environment before running any exercise:

```bash
workon qe
```

## Exercises

### Example 1: Phonons in silicon bulk (`01_Si_QE_a`, `01_Si_QE_b`)

**a) Phonons at the Gamma point**
Compute the vibrational frequencies of bulk Si at the zone centre using Quantum ESPRESSO (`ph.x`). This potentially gives direct access to the Raman/IR-active modes and is the simplest starting point for a phonon calculation.

**b) Phonon dispersion**
Extend the calculation to a uniform **q**-point grid, Fourier-interpolate the interatomic force constants with `q2r.x` and `matdyn.x`, and plot the full phonon band structure along a high-symmetry path.

### Example 2: Phonons in a polar material — AlAs (`02_AlAs_QE_a`, `02_AlAs_QE_b`)

**a) Phonons at the Gamma point**
Repeat the zone-centre calculation for AlAs. Because AlAs is a polar semiconductor, non-analytic corrections (Born effective charges and the macroscopic dielectric tensor) are essential to reproduce the LO-TO splitting.

**b) Phonon dispersion**
Compute and plot the full dispersion for AlAs, including the non-analytic corrections along the high-symmetry path to correctly capture the LO-TO splitting near Γ.

### Example 3: Relaxation and phonons with a MLIP (`03_phonons_mlip`)

> **Environment**: this part uses a different Python environment. Deactivate the QE environment first, then activate the MLIP one:
> ```bash
> conda deactivate qe
> ```

Open the notebook in JupyterLab, either launch it from the desktop shortcut, or from the terminal:

```bash
jupyter-lab 03_phonons_mlip/day2_mlip_ase_eos_relax_phonons.ipynb
```

Use the **UPET PET-MAD** machine-learning interatomic potential (via ASE) to:

1. Scan the equation of state (EOS) and fit a Birch–Murnaghan curve for Si and AlAs.
2. Relax the unit cell with `FrechetCellFilter` + BFGS and compare the relaxed volume against the EOS minimum.
3. Compute phonon band structures from finite displacements for both materials along the Γ → X → W → X → Γ → L path and compare with the DFPT results.
